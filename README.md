## Problem
Given the dataset `dataset.npy`, make a 80%-20% train-test split. Train a deep neural network that is based on RNN, CNN, or both. Evaluate the model on the test set.

To access the inputs/outputs, use the following API:

A data point in the dataset consists of a gene and its resistance status against a drug. A gene is a string of DNA letters that gets translated into a protein, or a string of amino acid.
